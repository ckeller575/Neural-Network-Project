# Neural-Network-Project
-My project runs through the UI.py file.
-This file creates a UI using pygame, and network.py is the neural network itself.
-CK_builder.py is how I built my personal dataset (stored in data.pickle), and CK_loader.py is how I load the dataset into my neural network.
-The png images show how I tried to match the MNIST dataset with my UI, but even though they looks visually similar, this didn't work.
-Finally, Demo.mov is a demonstration of the network and UI in action!
